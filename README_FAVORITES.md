# Favorites Functionality

This document explains the favorites system that has been added to the Tamil PDF Library website.

## Features

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Heart Button on PDFs
- Each PDF card now has a heart button in the top-right corner
- Click the heart to add/remove PDFs from your favorites
- Heart turns red (‚ù§Ô∏è) when favorited, white (ü§ç) when not favorited

### üîê User Authentication Required
- You must be signed in with Google to use favorites
- Favorites are tied to your Google account
- Your favorites are saved in Firebase Firestore

### üìö Favorites Section
- New "‚ù§Ô∏è Favorites" link in the navigation (only visible when signed in)
- View all your favorited PDFs in one place
- Empty state with helpful message when no favorites exist

## Technical Setup

### Firebase Configuration
The favorites system uses Firebase Firestore to store user favorites. Make sure your Firebase project has:

1. **Authentication enabled** with Google sign-in
2. **Firestore Database enabled** with the following security rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

### Database Structure
User favorites are stored in Firestore with this structure:

```
users/{userId}
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ email: string
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ displayName: string
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ favorites: string[] (array of PDF IDs)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ createdAt: timestamp
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ updatedAt: timestamp
```

## How It Works

### 1. User Authentication
- When a user signs in with Google, their favorites are automatically loaded
- The favorites link appears in the navigation
- User's favorites are stored in memory for quick access

### 2. Adding/Removing Favorites
- Click the heart button on any PDF card
- The action is immediately saved to Firestore
- The UI updates instantly to reflect the change
- If not signed in, an alert prompts the user to sign in

### 3. Viewing Favorites
- Click "‚ù§Ô∏è Favorites" in the navigation
- All favorited PDFs are displayed in a grid
- If no favorites exist, a helpful message is shown with a link to browse categories

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

## Future Enhancements
